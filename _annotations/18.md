Pedro Dong, Salomon Ma, and Helcio Almeida, "[Letter Sent by Brother Dong Yu Lan]({{ site.pdf }}/documents/2004-12-13-letter-to-jorge-navas.pdf)," December 13, 2004 (sent as a response to the Ambato brothers' decision to follow the ministry of the age):

> Some Brothers from Ambato—Rodrigo López, Fernando Mendieta and Waldemar Quintero—with influence from abroad disregard all that the spirit has accomplished in these years and propagate death saying that they have the freedom to receive other ministries, thus rejecting and disregarding God's delegated authority, the one who has cared for the region as a Father. 

The allegation of "influence from abroad" is without basis. It is typical of Brother Dong's workers to meet any decision not to follow Brother Dong's work with accusations. In fact, the brothers in Ambato merely declared their intention to receive the general ministry in the Lord's recovery and not to follow Brother Dong's regional and divisive work.
