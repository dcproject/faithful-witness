Dong Yu Lan, testimony given in Taipei, Taiwan, November 23, 1981:

> In 1958 and 1959, Brother Lee returned from his visit to Europe and America. He told us, "You have been enjoying the Lord so much in Taipei, while Christianity in the West is still in a state of desolation. You should receive the burden to migrate." Thank the Lord; at that time, not knowing anything, I moved to Brazil in a simple way.

Chang Wu-Chen, testimony given in Taipei, Taiwan, November 23, 1981:

> In 1958 and 1959, Brother Lee shared in a conference that the Lord's recovery had not yet spread out. Although in Taiwan many people had been under the leading and received training, they just "occupied the nest without laying eggs." At that time, a few brothers had the burden to go to Brazil. Brother Dong went to Brazil in 1960. In 1970, I visited Brazil and stayed there for two weeks. Later, because something happened in Hong Kong, I came back and went to Hong Kong with Brother Lee.

Interview with Samuel Cheng, May 8, 2008:

> Chang Wu-Chen had fellowship with Brother Lee in Los Angeles about me going to Brazil. Brother Lee felt good about it. I received letters from Chang Wu-Chen and Witness Lee about my going to Brazil. In 1974, I went there, arriving on January 1, 1974.

[Statement from Fernando Monte-Serrat]({{ site.pdf }}/reports/fernando-monte-serrat.pdf), October 26, 2007:

> By that time [in the mid-1970s], it was Brothers Chang Wu Chen, and Samuel Cheng (Cheng Pao Shu) who released conferences in Brazil.

[Statement from Fernando Monte-Serrat]({{ site.pdf }}/reports/fernando-monte-serrat.pdf), October 26, 2007:

> In 1977, because of an urgent need, Brother Dong was forced to give some messages in a conference in the city of Belo Horizonte, together with Brother Samuel Ma (Ma Shou Tao). From that time on Brother Dong started to give conferences throughout Brazil as well as in other South American countries.
