[Elders' Training, Book 9: The Eldership and the God-ordained Way (1)](http://www.ministrybooks.org/books.cfm?xid=7TMZ98QLAECK8), p. 56:

> From 1974 to the present time, approximately three hundred churches, mostly in Mexico, Puerto Rico, Central America, and South America, were raised up through the Life-study publications. One brother who was sent by the Lord to Brazil used the one hundred and twenty messages of the Life-study of Genesis to raise up close to one hundred churches there. Hundreds of churches were raised up and continually fed with these publications.
