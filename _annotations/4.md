From "A Turning Point in the Testimony of the Church," _The Ministry of the Word_, Vol. 7, pp. 962-965. This is a report on Brother Lee's visit to Brazil, co-signed by three brothers: Liu Xian-zhou, Zhang Xing-rong, and Dong Yu Lan.

Brother Lee's early visits to Brazil were also mentioned by Marco Mello with Dong Yu Lan and Pedro Dong at Brother Lee's memorial meeting, July 9, 1997:

> In 1964 Brother Lee came to São Paulo and confirmed the church there. He visited us again in 1965 and 1969 and shared with us the exercise of the human spirit by calling on the name of the Lord and pray-reading the Word. (A Memorial Biography of Brother Witness Lee, p. 60)
