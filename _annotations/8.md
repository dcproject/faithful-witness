[Statement from David Franco]({{ site.pdf }}/reports/david-franco.pdf), June 18, 2008:

> A co-worker called Samuel Cheng from Taiwan, who had been in Indonesia, moved to Brazil to help with the young people and the work in Brazil. In the mid-1970s Brother Chang Wu-Chen also visited Brazil often. Brother Samuel Cheng was especially effective in helping the young people and young adults among the Brazilians.

Notes from an interview with Samuel Cheng, May 8, 2008:

> Chang Wu-Chen had fellowship with Brother Lee in Los Angeles about me going to Brazil. Brother Lee felt good about it. I received letters from Chang Wu-Chen and Witness Lee about my going to Brazil. In 1974, I went there, arriving on January 1, 1974.
