title: Brother Dong's Claim That Brother Lee Did Not Want His Co-workers to Labor in South America 
ref: 19

Letter to 21 co-workers from "Your brothers and co-workers in South America," June 20, 2005:

> Due to the negative experience with Austin Sparks, Brother Lee has advised Brother Dong not a few times, in private fellowships, not to invite other co-workers to minister the word in South America, in spite of Brother Dong's insistent attempts in bringing the co-workers from the U.S. to come minister the word in Brazil. Time after time Brother Lee discouraged Brother Dong from doing so, and encouraged him to take the lead in the work in South America, advising him to only follow the leading of the Spirit according to the needs of the churches in South America and to be faithful to the burden given by the Lord Himself.

Dong Yu Lan, International Conference at Estância Árvore da Vida, February 22, 2007, Message 11:

> One time two US co-workers, John Ingalls and Benson Phillips, wanted to go to Guatemala to preach the gospel. They had the burden to go and had already found their translators. At that time Brother Lee was in Taiwan leading the training. When he heard about this, he made a long distance call to me, saying, "Brother Dong, two American co-workers are going there to work. The Spanish-speaking and Portuguese-speaking work has been entrusted to you by the Lord. It should be you going there to preach the gospel. You should also bring your own translators such as Pedro, Miguel, or Ezra, or your son, Andres."

Miguel Ma, Conference in Uberlandia, Brazil, June 2, 2007:

> Brother Lee told Brother Dong, do not invite the co-workers that are around me to come to South America so that they can speak things. Brother Dong asked why. Brother Lee said they can speak the right things, but the way they do things is different, and by the fact that they speak, they can transmit a different way to do things and they can create problems there. So don't do that.

Dong Yu Lan, National Conference in Barranquilla, Colombia, August 16, 2008, Message 1:

> Why did Brother Lee for more than twenty years forbid the American brothers, co-workers, or other co-workers to come to Brazil? Why? Because he knew that Brother Dong's leading is completely according to his burden and his work of life.

Brother Dong's statement is self-serving and inaccurate. As he often does, he takes a statement that may or may not have been made in private in a particular situation and, if it suits him, continues to trumpet it decades after it was made. In doing so, he neglects all public and private statements that would contradict his application of that statement. Brother Lee made many public statements concerning his desire for his co-workers to visit South America (see notes 21 and 22), and he also stated that he himself would not go to South America because to do so would be to build up Brother Dong's work (see note 29), which was different from his (see note 30). This directly contradicts Brother Dong's claim here that Brother Lee would not allow his co-workers to come to South America because he knew Brother Dong was doing the same work that Brother Lee was.

Letter from the responsible brothers of the church in Cali, Colombia, October 18, 2007:

> On many occasions the church in Cali tried to invite the co-workers from the USA, but [brothers] who follow Brother Dong Yu Lan's leadership and are his assigned co-workers for Colombia, did not approve. They argued that Brother Lee instructed Brother Dong not to invite co-workers to visit the churches in South America. Brother Dong himself made the same claim in a conference in Bogotá, Colombia, in April 2005.

Note: In 2002 Gary Kaiser proposed to Ezra Ma that two of Brother Dong's co-workers in Colombia travel with the North American co-workers to Cali. Ezra responded that this was a very good idea but that Gary needed to fellowship with Brother Dong. When Gary did so, Brother Dong said, "No," because to do so would give the brothers in Cali a "further excuse for rebellion." He also expressed concern that Gary would speak differently than Brother Dong and told Gary that he should read Brother Dong's books to learn how he teaches. This was a further indication that Brother Dong realized his speaking was different from that of the co-workers throughout the Lord's recovery and that he wanted to keep his own work separate from the one work in the Lord's recovery.
