##### 1960s

> Suppose the saints in the church here [in Los Angeles] feel the need to invite a worker from Texas. They have the full liberty to invite him. If they feel the need to invite another one from Europe, another one from Africa, and another one from South America, they have the full liberty to do so. This is the proper way for us to practice. ([The Life and Way for the Practice of the Church Life](http://www.ministrybooks.org/books.cfm?xid=AQQ6CARBG1F1Q), p. 114). (1963)

> We are the children of Abraham, who migrated, traveled, and sojourned all the time. Some may need to migrate from the west coast to the east coast, passing through Idaho, Missouri, Chicago, and other places in the Midwest, Boston, Washington D. C., Florida, and then on to Mexico, Central America, and South America. Do not be settled; do not be "those who dwell on the earth." ([A General Sketch of the New Testament in the Light of Christ and the Church, Part 4: Revelation](http://www.ministrybooks.org/books.cfm?xid=LZ5RQA7EKX6SK), p. 383) (1964)

> I have the assurance that the Lord is merciful to us. If in addition to this we are faithful to Him, in no more than three years some brothers and sisters will go out for the purpose of the gospel. Some may go to the east coast, Canada, Mexico, or South America, not as missionaries but simply as disciples going out for the gospel. For the Lord's recovery we need to go out. ([Serving in the Meetings and in the Gospel](http://www.ministrybooks.org/books.cfm?xid=GR8XIL8SEIJIR), p. 64) (1964)

##### 1970s

> The United States is located at the crossroads of the world with two great oceans, the Atlantic and the Pacific, on two sides like the two wings of an eagle. It is easy to move in any direction from the United States: from the Pacific coast we can take care of Asia and the Far East; from the Atlantic coast we can take care of Europe and Africa. We can also take care of North and South America. This is wonderful! This is God's sovereignty. ([The Kingdom](http://www.ministrybooks.org/books.cfm?xid=KU0AKH9S8ABZ1), p. 111) (1972)
