Dong Yu Lan, testimony given in Taipei, Taiwan, November 23, 1981:

>In 1958 and 1959 Brother Lee returned from his visit to Europe and America. He told us, "You have been enjoying the Lord so much in Taipei, while Christianity in the West is still in a state of desolation. You should receive the burden to migrate." Thank the Lord; at that time, not knowing anything, I moved to Brazil in a simple way.

Chang Wu-Chen, testimony given in Taipei, Taiwan, November 23, 1981:

> In 1958 and 1959 Brother Lee shared in a conference that the Lord's recovery had not yet spread out. Although in Taiwan many people had been under the leading and received training, they just "occupied the nest without laying eggs." At that time, a few brothers had the burden to go to Brazil. Brother Dong went to Brazil in 1960. In 1970 I visited Brazil and stayed there for two weeks.
