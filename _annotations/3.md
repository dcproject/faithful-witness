See note 1.

Interview with Samuel Cheng, May 8, 2008:

> Dong Yu Lan owned a chicken farm in Brazil. For a long time there were just Chinese-speaking saints in SÃ£o Paulo.

[Statement from Fernando Monte-Serrat]({{ site.pdf }}/reports/fernando-monte-serrat.pdf), October 26, 2007:

> In the beginning Brother Dong humbly sought diligently the words of Brother Lee, attending the trainings, listening to the tapes of the trainings, and conferences, and seeking to convey those words in the different conferences he gave in South America. In his testimonies, he used to say that he didn't go to Brazil to do a work, because he was not a Christian worker, but just a businessman.
