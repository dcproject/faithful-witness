title: Brother Dong Begins to Publish His Own Speaking in 1985 
ref: 24

The earliest printed messages by Brother Dong were single messages published in 1985:

* A Visão do Tabernáculo [The Vision of the Tabernacle]
* As Riquezas Insondáveis de Cristo [The Unsearchable Riches of Christ]

Both series were heavily plagiarized from Brother Lee's messages in the Life-study of Genesis and Life-study of Exodus and also included portions that contradicted Brother Lee's ministry. No Old Testament Life-studies were published after the Life-study of Exodus, per Brother Dong's instructions to the EÁV editorial staff in the summer of 1985:

> In 1985 I had traveled with Brother Dong on several occasions as he released the first messages he would publish later that year. It began with a series of messages under general subject As Riquezas Insondáveis de Cristo (The Unsearchable Riches of Christ). The second series of messages was A Visão do Tabernáculo (The Vision of Tabernacle). At first, these messages were published as individual messages to replace the individual messages of the Life-Studies of Genesis and Exodus, which up until then had been used weekly by the churches in their meetings. Brother Dong decided that, from the 1985 Summer Training on, the trainings and conferences sponsored by Living Stream Ministry would no longer be published in the Portuguese language. After publishing translations of the Life-study of Genesis and Exodus, the Life-studies of the Old Testament were replaced by books by Brother Dong covering Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Daniel, Minor Prophets, etc. (Personal Testimony of Laerte Salvador, June 18, 2008)
