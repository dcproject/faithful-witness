Dong Yu Lan, testimony given in Taipei, Taiwan, November 23, 1981:

> In those years, however, we were unable to bring in local people. The brother often told us that a church must bring in the local people. We made an effort but did not succeed. In 1972 the Lord sent Brother Chang Wu-chen to Brazil, thus opening the door to the local people.

[Note: There is no plural in Chinese. When Brother Dong says, "The brother," the translator understands this to refer to Brother Lee.]
