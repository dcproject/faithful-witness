## Excerpts

The following statement was issued by the co-workers in 2006 in the midst of a turmoil. Their statement and the accompanying excerpts apply equally well to the problems facing the recovery today due to the divisive work of Brother Dong Yu Lan and his co-workers.

> In the aftermath of the last major turmoil in the Lord's recovery, which took place in the late 1980s, Brother Witness Lee spoke extensively in a number of elders' meetings and ministry conferences on what he then referred to as the "present rebellion." He addressed in detail the source of the turmoil and the way to deal with it. Today his ministry on this matter can be found in no less than ten books published by Living Stream Ministry.

> Similar to the way that Moses recounted the rebellions of the Israelites in the book of Numbers and the way that Paul recorded the opposition of ungodly men in 2 Timothy, Brother Lee reviewed the history and unveiled the intrinsic nature of the problems in the recovery, and with frank words of warning and admonition, he provided instruction for their scriptural remedy. In a time of dissension and confusion, the saints in the recovery will do well to prayerfully read and study his words in order to be able to discern their situation and face it properly. The help our brother's writings can render to the saints and the churches, with the wisdom, truth, and principles contained in them, is incalculable.

> Below you will find a list of seventeen books that include messages given by Brother Lee from 1984 to 1996 on issues pertinent to the present situation in the Lord's recovery. Attached to this letter are excerpts from some of these books. We strongly recommend these writings to all the co-workers, elders, and seeking saints in the Lord's recovery.
