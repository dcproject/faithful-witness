    * Letters of warning, including the warning letter written by the co-workers to the saints in the Lord's recovery as well as letters of fellowship and warning issued by brothers in Mexico, Spain, Central America and the Caribbean, Canada, Colombia, Germany, Italy, Switzerland, and South Africa. This section includes "A Word of Affirmation, Apology, and Assurance to All the Saints and Churches in the Lord's Recovery."
    * A further word clarifying the co-workers' standing regarding the work of Dong Yu Lan and his co-workers.
    * Articles related to the problems caused by Brother Dong's work, including Principles Concerning the Lord's Table in View of the Oneness of the Body of Christ

We present the materials on this site to the saints in the Lord's recovery that they may realize the seriousness of the deviations in and turn away from Brother Dong's work and those who promote it. May the Lord have mercy on us all that we would take the way of practicing the oneness and the one accord to be preserved in His unique recovery for the building up of the Body of Christ in preparation for His soon return.
