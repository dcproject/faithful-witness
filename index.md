We present the materials on this site to the saints in the Lord's recovery that they may realize the seriousness of the deviations in and turn away from Brother Dong's work and those who promote it. May the Lord have mercy on us all that we would take the way of practicing the oneness and the one accord to be preserved in His unique recovery for the building up of the Body of Christ in preparation for His soon return.
