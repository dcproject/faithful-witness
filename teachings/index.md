## Deviations from the Truth in the Teachings of Dong Yu Lan

The teachings of Brother Dong Yu Lan deviate from the truth in the New Testament on many important points. Many of these are outlined in the letters of warning from the co-workers and the brothers in various parts of the earth. These deviations will be more thoroughly documented and corrected in articles as the development this site progresses. For those who know the truth, the attached set of quotes from the speaking and writing of Dong Yu Lan and his co-workers is sufficient to demonstrate the extent of their deviation.
